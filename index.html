<div class="title">Despite Pittsburgh not being known as a particularly fashion centric area, it has a surprisingly large community focused around J-Fashion, or Japanese street fashion. Lolita is a specifically widely followed substyle of J-Fashion that has been growing dramatically in western communities over the last decade. This mini-site is a brief overview of the purpose and activities of the Pittsburgh Gothic & Lolita community.</div>

<div class="h1">About The Style</div>

Lolita fashion is (contrary to its name's connotations) a very mature, elegant, pure fashion that focuses on lace, ruffles, flowers, fancy accessories, and other typically feminine styles. It is based on Victorian and Rococo era clothing and intends to display girlish charm in a very elegant manner. 
<br><br>
Lolita is actually a bigger term for many substyles that make up the fashion base. These come and go over the years, and some are strictly more popular than others. The most popular Lolita substyles are:
<ul>
  <li><b>Gothic Lolita</b>: A dark style that incorporates many elements of gothic fashion. </li>
  <li><b>Sweet Lolita</b>: A very childish, girly style that uses many pastels and kid-like designs.</li>
  <li><b>Classic Lolita</b>: A very simple, mature style that has a very antique aesthetic.</li>
</ul>

<div class="h2">History of Lolita Fashion</div>

Lolita emerged as a named fashion sometime in the 1990s. It was around previous to that, but still finding its roots and highly unrecognizable from the frilly aesthetic known today. It drew influences from many styles from many eras before settling into the Victorian, Rococo, feminine style it is today. It gained popularity as a Japanese street fashion (think Harajuku street snaps) but has exponentially gained traction across the entire globe. Though many of the popular clothing brands for Lolita fashion such as <a href="http://www.angelicpretty.com/en/">Angelic Pretty</a> and <a href="http://www.babyssb.co.jp/">Baby, The Stars Shine Bright</a> are still Japanese brands, there are now Lolitas in nearly every country and even some brand stores.
<br><br>

<div class="h3">What is Lolita Not?</div>

Lolita fashion is often misportrayed by media that tries to "expose" the niche scene and by curious onlookers who can't see past the name. I feel like everytime I have to introduce someone new to the style, I need to include a bunch of warning labels clearly stating all the things Lolita fashion is <i>not</i>.
<br><br>
First, Lolita has <b>nothing</b> to do with the Vladimir Nabokov novel. I personally have never even touched that book because of all the grief it has brought towards this style, so I don't know what happens in it but I can promise it has nothing to do with the fashion.
<br><br>
Secondly, there are no <i>living dolls</i>. I wish I could go back in time and make sure TLC never made that terrible episode of "My Strange Addiction". Sadly, this misinformed tv show is mostly all anyone who isn't a part of the fashion knows of it. In the episode, Lolita is paired with a guy who has plastic surgery to become a Ken doll and completely portrayed in a way that is not true. I promise you, you will <b>never</b> find a Lolita who wants to literally be a doll. It is just clothes.

<div class="h1">What are we?</div>

The Pittsburgh Gothic & Lolita group is a community centered around organizing events where local Lolitas can dress up together, make friends, and share fun experiences all while looking super <b>fancy</b>. Lolita is a tricky fashion to wear in public and it can be much easier to deal with the comments, sly photo taking, etc. when you are with a group of other frilly friends.

<div class="h2">What do we do?</div>
Pittsburgh is lucky to have a rather large sized community and therefore, lots of members willing to host events. Usually once or twice a month there are meetups members can attend that are hosted by other members. These are usually activites like picnics, ice skating, bowling, going out to lunch, seeing a play, or other fun things to do. Occasionally there will be themed meets, like our upcoming Harry Potter Halloween meet this weekend. 
<br><br>
Twice a year we celebrate winter and summer ILD (International Lolita Day). These days are celebrated by Lolitas across the globe with more planned, fancier events such as high tea, tea service, or a gala. These events are where members usually pull out their best coordinates and often cost a bit of money to attend. 

<div class="h3">Where to find us</div>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/265210708523/">Facebook Group</a>
<br><br>
Since the fall of livejournal (the previous online hangout place of Lolitas) facebook is now the central hub for Lolita community activities. Most communities, like ours, have a group page that interested members can join. Often you'll have to message a moderator and prove you at least know what the fashion is, but after that you're good to go!
